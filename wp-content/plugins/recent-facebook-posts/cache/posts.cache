The single biggest source? Sugary drinks. Extra calories from all that sugar leads to weight gain that can put people at risk for lifelong health problems such as diabetes and heart disease.\r\n\r\nDid you know, Soda is the top source of sugar in the American diet? U.S. teens drink twice as much soda as milk. Americans spend $73.9 billion annually on sugary soft drinks. Sugary drinks do not make you feel full, they do not quench your thirst and they may actually make you hungrier and thirstier for a few hours after drinking them.\r\n\r\nSugar adds up more than people realize. On average, Americans consume over 300 more calories per day than we did 30 years ago. Almost 50 percent of those calories come from sugary drinks, making them a major contributor to the obesity epidemic.\r\n\r\nHow does this add up? Drinking just one 20-ounce bottle of soda each day for a year can result in gaining 25 extra pounds.\r\n\r\nMany sports drinks and vitamin waters have fewer calories and less sugar than soda, but they still have a lot. Consuming just one of these drinks every day for a year will result in a 10 to 13 pound weight gain. Avoid them unless you are participating in a triathlon or other very strenuous exercise.\r\n\r\nEnergy drinks are often full of sugar and caffeine. Drink just one per day and you'll see about 20 pounds added to your weight. A better way to get the energy you need? Healthy eating, regular exercise, and plenty of sleep.\r\n\r\nAnd while coffee drinks might give you a pick-me-up feeling, the average coffee drink adds over 300 calories to your day. That can mean 30 extra pounds of weight gain per year. If you need a quick fix, tea or coffee drinks made with nonfat milk are better choices.\r\n\r\nHealthy drink choices-\r\nInstead of sugary drinks, try another refreshing thirst-quencher...\r\n\r\nAdd a slice of orange, lemon, lime, or cucumber to your water for a boost of flavor.\r\n\r\nMix sparkling water with a splash of your favorite fruit juice.\r\n\r\nMix in just a bit of pomegranate or cranberry juice and lime in your unsweetened iced tea, or add cut-up peaches and fresh mint sprigs if you like it sweetened.\r\n\r\n*If you think the options above taste too 'weak' for you because you've been drinking the sugary stuff so long, you're not alone. Lots of people feel this way at first because they are used to drinking so much sugar. Sugar is actually physically addictive like caffeine and Nicotine are. That's why it's easier to slowly ween yourself off it than to quit 'cold turkey'. If you'd like, feel free to try the trick I pulled on my hubby. He was a soda addict when we met. He loved drinking really unhealthy stuff like Coke, Dr Pepper, Mountain Dew, etc. So, I slowly started weaning him off soda by having him drink homemade lemonade instead. (Which is also MUCH cheaper than soda btw. I save at least 20 bucks a week not buying soda) It's really easy! If you have a juicer, feel free to use fresh lemons because it tastes better, but bottled (ORGANIC!) lemon juice is fine too. First, I'd dissolve 9 tablespoons of sugar (in a glass with a spout for easy pouring) with some boiling water, and I added 13-14 tablespoons of lemon juice. From there, you can just pour it right in a 2 liter bottle or pitcher, fill it to the top with water and give it a shake or stir. Then, you just serve it over a tall glass of ice and it's really delicious. Very refreshing! He never complained nor did he miss drinking soda. After a few weeks or so, I'd put less and less sugar and less and less lemon in the lemonade I made him. Eventually, I got him down to 5 or 6 tbs sugar and around 9 tbs lemon per 2 liter. Sometimes he even drinks water with just a squeeze of lemon or fruit juice and he loves it, whereas months ago he said he didn't like it 'because it had no flavor'. At present, he can't even drink soda like he used to because it's too sweet for him and he's now able to notice that soda just makes him more thirsty. He may still be drinking some sugar in homemade lemonade, but at least it's not 20 tablespoons of sugar per 2 liter anymore. (Yep! Coke has the equivalent of 20 tablespoons of sugar per 2 liter. Plus, I put raw, organic sugar in my lemonade. Not glucose-fructose syrup made from genetically modified sugar beets like Coke-a-Cola and PepsiCo do) You can also puree fresh fruit or berries like strawberries or raspberries in with the lemonade, then you just strain it so there's no big chunks or seeds. It tastes sooo good! Trust me, you'll love it.\r\n\r\nIf you're more of an Iced tea drinker, here is a tasty recipe that doesn't take a lot of sugar. Just keep in mind, there can be a lot of Fluoride in certain teas. Especially green tea and black tea. (I wouldn't drink the instant 'just mix with water' teas either. They are almost as bad as soda.) Organic, white tea is by far the safest to drink. I like mixing mine with a little lemon and honey .","image":"http:\/\/photos-f.ak.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ak-ash4\/993004_515590721829888_1038910878_s.jpg","timestamp":1371280355,"like_count":1,"comment_count":0,"link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/506450296077264\/posts\/515590731829887"},{"author":{"id":"506450296077264","category":"Community","name":"Usefull Information"},"content":"","image":"http:\/\/photos-e.ak.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ak-frc1\/1002418_515288335193460_942940426_s.jpg","timestamp":1371227426,"like_count":1,"comment_count":0,"link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/506450296077264\/posts\/515288345193459"},{"author":{"id":"506450296077264","category":"Community","name":"Usefull Information"},"content":"","image":null,"timestamp":1371225369,"like_count":0,"comment_count":0,"link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/506450296077264\/posts\/515278615194432"},{"author":{"id":"506450296077264","category":"Community","name":"Usefull Information"},"content":"","image":"http:\/\/photos-c.ak.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ak-prn1\/1013690_515278055194488_2114069682_s.jpg","timestamp":1371225319,"like_count":1,"comment_count":0,"link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/506450296077264\/posts\/515278065194487"},{"author":{"id":"506450296077264","category":"Community","name":"Usefull Information"},"content":"","image":"http:\/\/photos-g.ak.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ak-ash4\/1005887_514862191902741_406480077_s.jpg","timestamp":1371188745,"like_count":1,"comment_count":0,"link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/506450296077264\/posts\/514862198569407"},{"author":{"id":"506450296077264","category":"Community","name":"Usefull Information"},"content":"11 Health Benefits of Pomegranate Juice~\r\n\r\n1)Fights Breast Cancer\r\nStudies in Israel show that pomegranate juice destroys breast cancer cells while leaving healthy cells alone.

Discover how the \u201cking of fruits\u201d can help you, plus fascinating trivia and a few mango cautions and concerns.\r\n\r\nHealth Benefits:\r\n\r\n1. Prevents Cancer:\r\nResearch has shown antioxidant compounds in mango fruit have been found to protect against colon, breast, leukemia and prostate cancers. These compounds include quercetin, isoquercitrin, astragalin, fisetin, gallic acid and methylgallat, as well as the abundant enzymes.\r\n\r\n2. Lowers Cholesterol:\r\nThe high levels of fiber, pectin and vitamin C help to lower serum cholesterol levels, specifically Low-Density Lipoprotein (the bad stuff)\r\n\r\n3. Clears the Skin:\r\nCan be used both internally and externally for the skin. Mangos clear clogged pores and eliminate pimples. (Read more on page 5.)\r\n\r\n4. Eye Health:\r\nOne cup of sliced mangoes supplies 25 percent of the needed daily value of vitamin A, which promotes good eyesight and prevents night blindness and dry eyes.\r\n\r\n5. Alkalizes the Whole Body:\r\nThe tartaric acid, malic acid, and a trace of citric acid found in the fruit help to maintain the alkali reserve of the body.\r\n\r\n6. Helps in Diabetes:\r\nMango leaves help normalize insulin levels in the blood. The traditional home remedy involves boiling leaves in water, soaking through the night and then consuming the filtered decoction in the morning. Mango fruit also have a relatively low glycemic index (41-60) so moderate quantities will not spike your sugar levels.\r\n\r\n7. Improved Sex:\r\nMangos are a great source of vitamin E. Even though the popular connection between sex drive and vitamin E was originally created by a mistaken generalization on rat studies, further research has shown balanced proper amounts (as from whole food) does help in this area.\r\n\r\n8. Improves Digestion:\r\nPapayas are not the only fruit that contain enzymes for breaking down protein. There are several fruits, including mangoes, which have this healthful quality. The fiber in mangos also helps digestion and elimination.\r\n\r\n9. Remedy for Heat Stroke\r\nJuicing the fruit from green mango and mixing with water and a sweetener helps to cool down the body and prevent harm to the body. From an ayurvedic viewpoint, the reason people often get diuretic and exhausted when visiting equatorial climates is because the strong \u201csun energy\u201d is burning up your body, particularly the muscles. The kidneys then become overloaded with the toxins from this process.\r\n\r\n10. Boosts Immune system\r\nThe generous amounts of vitamin C and vitamin A in mangos, plus 25 different kinds of carotenoids keep your immune system healthy and strong.\r\n\r\nFacts and trivia:\r\n\r\n* According to some, more mangos are eaten fresh than any other fruit in the world.\r\n\r\n* Originated 4,000 plus years ago.\r\n\r\n* Biologically a close relative with other flowering plants like cashew and pistachio.\r\n\r\n* Originated in sub-Himalayan plains.\r\n\r\n* In India where they are most heavily grown and eaten, mangos are known as \u201csafeda.\u201d\r\n\r\n* There are over 1,000 different varieties of mangos.\r\n\r\nNutrition by the Numbers:-\r\n\r\nOne cup (225 gms contain) contains the following. Percentages apply to daily value.\r\n\r\n* 105 calories\r\n\r\n* 76 % vitamin C (antioxidant and immune booster)\r\n\r\n* 25 % vitamin A (antioxidant and vision)\r\n\r\n* 11 % vitamin B6 plus other B vitamins (hormone production in brain and heart disease prevention)\r\n\r\n* 9 % healthy probiotic fiber\r\n\r\n* 9 % copper (copper is a co-factor for many vital enzymes plus\r\nproduction of red blood cells)\r\n\r\n* 7 % potassium (to balance out our high sodium intake)\r\n\r\n* 4 % magnesium","image":"http:\/\/photos-f.ak.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-ak-prn1\/1017455_514198061969154_1758482452_s.jpg","timestamp":1371101593,"like_count":1,"comment_count":0,"link":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/506450296077264\/posts\/514198068635820"},{"author":{"id":"506450296077264","category":"Community","name":"Usefull Information"},"content":"This is interesting.
