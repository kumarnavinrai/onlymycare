And, home remedies for pigmentation are effective enough to moderate excessive secretion of melanin, a natural pigment in the body which is primarily responsible for skin discolouration and dark spots.

You will find that these brown spots generally appear on exposed skin areas like the face, back, neck, chest, shoulders and hands. There could be many causes for brown spots, but some of the main ones are sun exposure, aging, genetics, menopause, pregnancy, stress, improper skin care, weak liver, hyper pigmentation of the skin, lack of vitamin c or B12, cancer, dermatitis, and diabetes.\r\n\r\n<strong>Lemon Juice<\/strong>\r\n\r\nLemon has bleaching property and thus can help to get rid of brown spots, all you have to do is simply apply fresh lemon juice directly to the affected area, and leave it for an hour before rinsing it with cold water.

During summer sweat and oil secretions increase and these are deposited on the skin. An oily and sweaty skin also attracts more dirt and pollutants.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/onlymycare.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/Tips-for-acne-troubles-in-summer.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-2161\" alt=\"Tips for acne troubles in summer\" src=\"http:\/\/onlymycare.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/Tips-for-acne-troubles-in-summer.jpg\" width=\"275\" height=\"183\" \/><\/a>\r\n<h2>Cleansing is the keyword<\/h2>\r\nDaily cleansing and skin care, with appropriate products, is the only way of protecting the skin from eruptions and oily-skin problems. The pores must be kept free of hardened oil and the oiliness of the skin surface must also be reduced. If the skin is oily, an astringent toner should be used after cleansing. Wipe the face with it, using cotton. Some home ingredients can also be used. Rose water can be mixed with cucumber juice and applied on the face to reduce oiliness. Night-time cleansing is a must, to remove the pollutants that have been deposited on the skin during the day.\r\n<h2>Wash your face with plain water<\/h2>\r\nDuring summer, people tend to wash their face too often with soap and water. This actually destroys the normal acid-alkaline balance of the skin, since most soaps are alkaline in nature. If there is rash, pimples or acne, the face should be washed with a medicated soap, or medicated cleanser only twice a day, morning and night. You may wash the face several times a day with plenty of plain water.\r\n<h2>No blackheads, no acne<\/h2>\r\nPreventing blackheads help in the prevention of acne. If there are blackheads, a facial scrub should be used on the blackhead-prone areas. But do not apply scrubs on acne, pimples or rash. Mix rice powder with rose water. Apply it on the areas with blackheads daily. Rub gently on the skin with circular movements. Leave on for five minutes and wash off with water. This can be done after cleansing in the morning.\r\n<h2>Avoid use of oily creams<\/h2>\r\nIf the skin is oily and prone to eruptions, avoid the use of oily creams and moisturisers. If there is dryness of the skin, it is usually a superficial dryness of the outermost layer. For this, mix one teaspoon each of honey and curd and apply daily, washing off with plain water after 20 minutes\r\n\r\nA paste of fresh methi leaves can also be applied on the skin. Keep it on for 15 to 20 minutes and wash off with water.\r\n\r\nNeem leaves can also be used to treat rashes, pimples and acne. A handful of neem leaves can be simmered on very low fire in four cups of water for one hour. Leave it overnight. Next morning, strain and use the water to wash the face. Make a paste on the leaves and apply on pimples, rash and acne.\r\n\r\nIt is also important to make sure that the hair and scalp are kept scrupulously clean. If the scalp is oily, or if there is dandruff, it can lead to pimples and acne. Keep the hair away from the face while you sleep.\r\n<h2>Cleanliness is an important aspect<\/h2>\r\nIf your skin is prone to pimples, wash your pillow covers and towels often in warm soapy water, after adding two teaspoons of an antiseptic solution.\r\n\r\nAlso remember to wash your cosmetic brushes very often and dry them thoroughly before putting them away.\r\n<h2>Drink plenty of water<\/h2>\r\nAcne can be the result of a congested system. So, include fresh fruits, raw salads, sprouts, curd, in your daily diet and drink 6 to 8 glasses of water. Add the juice of a lemon to a glass of water and have it first thing in the morning. Last, but not least, if acne makes an appearance, get professional care in good time, because acne can spread and cause extensive scarring."},{"id":2178,"title":"Twisted Hair Band","content":""},{"id":2176,"title":"Cute and Easy Hairstyles","content":""},{"id":2174,"title":"Running late hair style","content":""},{"id":2167,"title":"How to lighten dark lips naturally","content":""},{"id":2052,"title":"Test videos","content":"<pre><code>\r\n<\/code><\/pre>"}],"language":"usenglish","listen_phrase":"Listen to this Post","loading_phrase":"Loading","play_phrase":"Play","stop_phrase":"Stop"};
