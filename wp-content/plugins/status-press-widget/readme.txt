Tags: widget, facebook, status, rss, feed, twitter, last.fm
Requires at least: 2.2
Tested up to: 2.7.1
Stable tag: 1.14

== Description ==
Adds a Status Widget to display your Facebook, Twitter, or Last.FM status in your sidebar, and allows you to have multiple widgets at once. Originally, based on Status Press plugin by Adam Walker Cleaveland (http://pomomusings.com/) &  C. Scott Andreas (http://www.paradoxica.net), this widget is growing outside the original intent to only work with Facebook.

== Installation ==
Extract the contents of the zip file and copy the `status-press-widget.php` file to your plugins directory. Then activate the Status Press Widget from within WordPress.

In order to connect your Status with this widget, follow these steps:

	1. Select which service you will be using
	2. Follow the instructions

Your status feed should then be available, so get busy making your sidebar look even more personal with your new Status Updater!

As a side note, if you have used the previous plugin before, you might know that there was a slight mathematical error in the original plugin. This miscalculation has been corrected in the Widget.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
